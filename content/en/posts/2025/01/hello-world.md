Happy New Year!

This project is finally officially meeting everyone!

The idea for the Borneo IoT project came to life in 2021.

As a software engineer who’s into freshwater aquariums and knows a bit about electronics, this project is my trial-and-error journey and what I’ve learned from it.

If you are interested in my open hardwares, please stay tuned.

We're excited to announce the pre-launch of our Buce Aquarium LED Controller on [Crowd Supply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/borneo-iot/buce-aquarium-led-controller)!

Dear aquarium enthusiasts and open-source makers,

We're excited to announce that our new project — the Buce Aquarium LED Controller — will soon launch on Crowd Supply! After months of design and testing, we're bringing a powerful yet compact open-source LED control platform to the community. Whether you're into reef tanks, planted aquariums, or simply love building your own lighting systems, Buce is made for you.

## How You Can Get Involved Before Launch

- Subscribe on Crowd Supply to be notified the moment the campaign goes live.
- Explore the specs to see how Buce can fit into your DIY project or professional setup.
- Plan your support: whether you need just the Core module, the driver board, or a complete lamp design.
- Spread the word: share the project with your community and let us know your ideas or feedback.

## Why Buce?

- Flexible: Mix and match the Core and driver to suit different lighting designs.
- Reliable: High-resolution PWM, thermal protection, and power management for stable operation.
- Open: Modify, extend, and contribute, this is more than a product, it's a community.
- Versatile: Beyond aquariums, Buce works great for plant lighting, creative lamps, or custom fixtures.

We're putting the final touches on the project and can't wait to share it with you.

## Electronics Design

### We design electronics for aquarium lights and related devices. You can start from our proven reference boards or ask for a custom design.

We focus on reliability, safety, and cost, and we deliver designs that are ready for manufacturing and easy to support.

## Software Customization

### Our firmware and mobile app are built in house and can be adapted to your brand and feature needs.

We can change the look and feel, add control modes and schedules, connect to your cloud, or keep everything private and offline. We handle updates, localization, and onboarding so you can focus on the product and the customer.

## Mechanical Design Services

### We help you create housings and fixtures that look good and are practical to build.

We pay attention to heat, sealing, and easy assembly so your product is ready for tooling and repeatable production. We can work with your designer or take it from concept to drawings and samples.

## Manufacturing Support

### We support pilot runs and mass production with our factory tools for testing and setup. 

We help plan the line, train operators, and track quality. Our production software and test fixtures are provided as part of the service and are not included in the public open source repo. The goal is simple: stable yield, good quality, and the best cost for your scale.

The idea for the Borneo IoT project came to life in 2021 because I couldn't afford a proper aquarium light, so I created my own.

As a software engineer who's into freshwater aquariums and knows a bit about electronics, this project is my trial-and-error journey and what I've learned from it.

Hope you can find some fun in it too!

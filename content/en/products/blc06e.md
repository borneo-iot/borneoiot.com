## Introduction

The BLC06E is an embedded smart 6-channel LED controller designed for professional freshwater and reef light manufacturers. It integrates all the complex and precise circuitry into a coin-sized package, is driven by our in-house firmware platform, and is controlled by the [Borneo-IoT App](/products/app).

Based on the [Buce](/products/buce) controller, the BLC06E has been optimized for cost and manufacturability for mass production. It uses an SMT board-to-board connector and a surface-mount screw nut for secure attachment, making it easy to connect to LED baseboards. Using the BLC06E eliminates the time and cost of firmware and app development, significantly accelerating time-to-market.

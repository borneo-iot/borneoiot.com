As you probably know, hardware development isn't the same as pure software. Buying components, making PCB prototypesâ€”all of that costs money. So, if you like this project or find it useful, please consider donating to support its further development. 

Let's turn this into a mature open-source product that makes smart aquarium devices affordable for everyone.

Thank you!

## Everything is Open-Source

The Borneo-IoT Project is an open-source hardware initiative, running with open-source firmware and provides an open-source mobile client app. All source code and design files are available on GitHub.

Being open-source and DIY-friendly does not mean it is crude, it is also designed with the potential of mass production in mind.

## Affordable yet Powerful Hardware

![](/uploads/photos/home/blc06mk1.jpg)

The hardware of the Borneo-IoT project is built around the popular, cost-effective Espressif ESP32 series WiFi MCU, without employing any specialized components or expensive fab techniques for the PCB. And yes, this is not a breadboard project, because my goal is to outperform commercial-grade products.

- The schematic and PCB layout were designed using [Horizon EDA](http://horizon-eda.org).
- The mechanical structure were created using FreeCAD.
- No 3D-printed components were involved.

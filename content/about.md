Borneo IoT is a full-stack open-source WiFi multi-channel PWM LED solution.

## Features

### Full-stack

From the hardware design, to the mobile app, everything is open-source, this project includes:

- ESP32-C3 based 5-channel LED PWM controller board design.
- ESP32-PICO-V3 based 10-channel LED PWM controller board design.
- 5-channel demo/dev board.
- Firmware developed based on the ESP-IDF framework.
- An easy-to-use mobile app developed using Flutter.

### Feature-rich

- Provides 5~10 channel PWM dimming signals.
- Multi-segment lighting for sunrise and sunset.
- PID automatic temperature control for cooling fans.
- Comprehensive automatic protection features.
- Based on CoAP and CBOR protocol, it provides a Python client library and demo scripts.
- And much more.

### Budget-friendly

- The MCU uses the popular ESP32-C3 (5-channel edition) or ESP32 (up to 10-channel edition), with no special components required.
- By using the built-in PWM-DAC voltage regulation circuit, it can directly drive cheap two-wire fans for speed control. It also supports PWM fans.

### Field-proven

I created a prototype LED light using this circuit design and firmware and have been running it for years.
